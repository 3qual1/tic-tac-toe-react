# Tic Tac Toe

Minimal Tic Tac Toe game built with React. Explicit state management, allowing instant change of previous game history states. An experimental and educational project.

Features:

- State time-travel – navigate through every move and observe the board change instantly.
- Deterministic UI – completely derived from the game state.
- Modern and minimal UI – visible transitions and color highlights for each interaction.

## Tech

- React 19 (`create-react-app`*)
- JavaScript
- GitHub Pages (deploying the build from `docs/` folder)

\* – `create-react-app` is a legacy, deprecated tool that is only meant for small, experimental projects like this one.

## Run & Build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/theParitet/tic-tac-toe-react
cd tic-tac-toe-react
npm install
```

`npm start` – to run the application locally.

`npm run build` – to build the application at `build/` folder.


## Background

This was my first project building with React.

Based on the official [React documentation tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).
