# Tic Tac Toe

Minimal Tic Tac Toe game built in React. Explicit state management, allowing instant change of previous game history states.

Features:

- State time-travel – navigate through every move and observe the board change in real time.
- Modern and minimal UI – completely derived from the game state.
